# Family Fun Helper
Welcome to Family Fun Helper. The application that helps families answer the question "What the heck do I do with my kid(s)?". Family Fun Helper suggests age appropriate, kid friendly activities to help fill weekends, evenings, holidays, and school vacations. Family Fun Helper allows the user to search for activities by keywords, sort activities by age appropriateness, location(indoor or outdoor), or cost(free or paid). Users can upload new activites for familiest to view, and use a randomizer function to have a fun activity presented to them.

This is a project for Flatiron School Software Engineer course, phase 2. This applicaiton was built by [Kassidy Matos](https://github.com/kassinovaa) & [Kevin J Stafford](https://github.com/kevinjstafford)

### Project Requirements

1. You must make a single page application (only one index.html file) using create-react-app.

2. Your app should use at least 5 components in a way that keeps your code well organized.

3. There should be at least 3 client-side routes using React RouterLinks to an external site.. Be sure to include a nav bar or other UI element that allows users to navigate between routes. |

4. Use a json-server to create a RESTful API for your backend and make both a GET and a POST request to the json server. Use a form to make your post request, specifically a controlled form/component. Additionally, you may choose to incorporate data from an external API but it is not required.

5. Add some styling: you're encouraged to write your CSS from scratch, either by using styled componentsLinks to an external site. or writing CSS files and using id/className to style your elements. You can also incorporate a UI framework (like React BootstrapLinks to an external site., Semantic UILinks to an external site., or Material UILinks to an external site.) if you prefer.
